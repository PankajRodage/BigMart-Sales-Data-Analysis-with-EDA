# BigMart Sales Data Analysis with EDA

## Project Description
   #### Overview
   This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the BigMart sales dataset. The goal is to analyze and visualize sales data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve business strategies. The dataset includes sales information for various products across different BigMart stores.

  #### Motivation
The analysis aims to understand the sales dynamics of BigMart stores, identify factors influencing sales performance, and provide actionable insights for optimizing inventory and marketing strategies. By exploring sales trends and store performance, businesses can make informed decisions to enhance profitability and efficiency.

 #### Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates to ensure data quality.
Univariate Analysis: Examining individual features such as sales distribution, product categories, and store performance.
Bivariate Analysis: Investigating relationships between sales and other variables like store location and product type.
Visualization: Creating various charts and plots to illustrate sales trends, distributions, and correlations.
